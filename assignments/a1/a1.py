    now long passed away, they had been living together as friend and
    friend very mutually attached, and Emma doing just what she liked;
    highly esteeming Miss Taylor's judgment, but directed chiefly by
    her own.
    The real evils, indeed, of Emma's situation were the power of having
    rather too much her own way, and a disposition to think a little
    too well of herself; these were the disadvantages which threatened
    alloy to her many enjoyments.
    It was Miss
    Taylor's loss which first brought grief.
